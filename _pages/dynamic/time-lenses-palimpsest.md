### Time Lenses is an installation of multiple displays and cameras that are carefully placed in a physical location to refract activity into a suite of rhythmically recomposed movements. Live video processing instruments will augment the space so that any activity, rehearsed or unrehearsed, quotidian or marked, will refract into a suite of projections, each revealing a different temporal or rhythmic aspect of the corporeal activity within the space. An activity in the space will appear on these life-size installations that act as temporal lenses or temporal mirrors. As a set, these time lenses explode captured movements into constituent rhythms and display them "contrapuntally" on the image surfaces arrayed in the space.
