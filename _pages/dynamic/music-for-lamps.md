### [Music for Lamps](https://www.musicforlamps.com) is an installation and performance work for 12 sound and light emitting lamps. Each lamp is discreetly outfitted with a surface transducer speaker, turning the lamps into both light and sound emitters. The lamps are arranged to both surround and permeate audience members, creating a 12 channel light and 14 channel sound performance.

### This work explores the continuum between the abstract qualities of sound and light, and the evocative qualities of domestic objects. Re-animated through digital technology, the lamps’ every “performance” is pulled apart and recombined in a novel manner. In this sense, Music for Lamps investigates both the potential of domestic objects, recalling their everyday functions and - through aesthetic transformation - transcending them.

### _in collaboration with Adam Basanta and Max Stein_
