### _Creative Coding/Development using cables.gl (WebGL)_

### Artificial Ecologies is a virtual exhibition: it is both an architectural space and thematic grouping of the artworks of Isabel Beavers, Maru Garcia, Richelle Gribble, and Julian Stein. The space embodies systems of ecology that shift in scale and relate through macro/micro relationships.
