### _Lighting Design, Software Development (Max/MSP)_

### _Einstein’s Dreams_ is an environment in which visitors encounter installations with responsive fields of video, light, and spatialized sound, in a set of tableaus. Each tableau is inspired by a vignette from Alan Lightman’s novel, _Einstein’s Dreams_. Performers work with the textures and rhythms of lighting, sound and visitors’ expectations to create different kinds of time poetically related to the novel’s vignette.
