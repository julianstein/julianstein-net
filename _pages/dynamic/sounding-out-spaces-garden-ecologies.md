### [Sounding Out Spaces](https://www.pariesa.com/single-post/garden-ecologies) is a site-responsive sonic art project that explores ecosystemic relationships between people, sounds and spaces. The project, which was started by sound artist and Arizona State University professor Lauren Hayes in 2014, involves musical and technical approaches for artistically responding to and participating in a given site. These sites have included buildings and spaces that have not been designated as concert venues, as well as outdoor urban and rural settings, and they range from retired industrial structures, visually stimulating landscapes, architecture with unique acoustic properties, natural environments, or places of cultural or historical significance.
