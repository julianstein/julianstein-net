### _Software Development (PureData), Multi-channel Sound Design_

“The interactive and immersive installation Turcot: la route devenue architecture offers a tour of an interchange from the point of view of a pedestrian or cyclist. The Satosphere’s spherical projection sweeps visitors into the heart of this gigantic work by offering a perceptual experience on human scale. Visitors can transform the interchange in real time, changing its structure and the journey, by manipulating a wooden model placed, like a construction game, at the centre of the dome. They create another architecture, one that is dynamic and unstable, altering the idea we have of the structure and its final form.”
